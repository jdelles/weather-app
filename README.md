## Introduction

This is the final project in this section of the JavaScript path titled Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs. Learning to work with APIs to fetch and parse data opens up an extensive list of new possibilities and begins to connect the idea of building in a separated front-end / back-end environment. Topics covered in this unit included the JS event loop, Promises, and async/await.

## Skill

-   APIs
-   Fetch
-   Parsing JSON
-   Webpack
-   npm
-   JavaScript
-   CSS
-   HTML

## Tools

-   VSCode
-   Git / GitHub
-   osX Console

## Resources

-   [Webpack tutorial and configuration](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration)
-   [Open Weather Map API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/current)

## To do

-   [x] Setup GitHub repo, basic file structure, webpack
-   [x] Write the functions that fetch data from the API and log data to console
-   [x] Write the functions that process the JSON data retrieved from the API and return an object with data required for the app
-   [x] Create a simple form that will allow users to enter a location and fetch the weather data for that location
-   [x] Display the info on the webpage
-   [x] Add styling
-   [ ] Optional: Add a "loading" graphic that displays while the data is being retrieved
-   [x] Publish to GitHub - will require additional config since it's looking for index.html but webpack is setup to use dist/index.html
